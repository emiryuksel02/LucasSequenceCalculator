# LucasSequenceCalculator
This project calculates a specified lucas sequence recursiv. 

The general Lucas sequence is a generalization of the Fibonacci sequence, which, like the Fibonacci sequence, is defined recursively:

𝑙𝑖 = 𝑝 · 𝑙𝑖−1 − 𝑞 · 𝑙𝑖−2 , with 𝑙0 = 0 und 𝑙1 = 1

Here 𝑝 and 𝑞 are parameters of the general Lucas sequence 𝑙𝑖. Setting 𝑝 = 1 and 𝑞 = −1 we get the Fibonacci sequence and with 𝑝 = 2 and 𝑞 = −1 we get the Pell sequence. By further varying the values of 𝑝 and 𝑞, numerous other sequences can be calculated.
